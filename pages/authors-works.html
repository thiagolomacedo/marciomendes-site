            <h3>TRECIRAL Initiation</h3>
            <p>This work is the first volume of a trilogy dedicated to TRECIRAL, which extends far beyond a mere movement technique, establishing itself as a genuine philosophy of life. Through a detailed exploration of body movement, this initial book demonstrates the foundations and core components that gave rise to TRECIRAL, including a thorough description and analysis of its logo symbolism. In this first part, the reader will find a comprehensive introduction and a detailed historical context, which seek to elucidate the origins and profound meaning of the methodology. Each subsequent chapter is dedicated to a distinct component of the technique, presented progressively and in an accessible manner. The goal is to ensure the reader not only assimilates the content but also experiences a continuous developmental process, evolving harmoniously and consistently with each new stage explored.</p>

            <h3>The Great Warrior</h3>
            <p>In a way, this work was created from the emergence of TRECIRAL, which took on a life of its own and is based on a fundamental human ability: the capacity to think and, consequently, to create. This distinctive aptitude — mental creation — is often overlooked by us. Our world is built through the act of thinking, a transformative force that constructs both beautiful and nefarious things. This happens simply because this function is not incorporated into human education and development — at least not in the right way. It is like a sword in the hands of someone blindfolded, without the slightest skill to wield it with precision and strength. I invite you to join in this awakening, described in this work, to your own mental capacity and to learn how to use it more effectively.</p>

            <h3>The Old Fisherman</h3>
            <p>One day like any other Gabriel played in the room, suddenly. He began telling a story to his noble mother. A fascinating story created by a ten-year-old boy, what was supposed to be a simple story of his homeschooling turned into a fascinating story of relationships, friendship, overcoming, and hope. This story of friendship brings with you also the compassion that is beyond the physical aptitudes of the person more, but of our fellowman. This is one of the great differences of our species in relation to others, characterizing us as human beings. Gabriel has been training football since he was five years old, and by the time he is ten years old, he already has a fascinating maturity that many adults do not have, besides he lives in three different cultures and speaks more than three languages, thus giving him It is a way of life beyond normal, different from a narrow view of life that a culture brings. And its advantage lies in the fact that it feeds on these different perspectives, making it a human being since then.</p>

            <h3>In Mila's Eyes</h3>
            <p>Mila's Vision presents the world through the eyes of a being who loves without hesitation: a female dog observing the human species. From her perspective, the relationship between humans and animals becomes a mirror—one that reflects not only our strengths, but also our contradictions. Mila sees humans as the dominant species on the planet, gifted with intelligence, creativity, and the unique ability to shape the world according to their will. Yet this same capacity often leads to confusion, sadness, and destructive behavior. From her loyal point of view, she observes a species that believes itself superior but frequently struggles to understand the true essence of life. Her reflections form a gentle, loving critique—one that comes from someone who would give her own life to protect us. Through her eyes, readers are invited to question what it really means to be "superior," and whether humans, despite all their power, have forgotten fundamental virtues such as presence, simplicity, loyalty, and unconditional love. Mila's intimate observations highlight the beauty of human potential and the tragedy of the distances we create from one another. Her voice reminds us that wisdom can come from unexpected places, and that sometimes the deepest truths about humanity are seen most clearly by those who live beside us, silently witnessing our joys, fears, and contradictions.</p>
